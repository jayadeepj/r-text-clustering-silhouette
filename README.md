## Silhouette Threshold Based Text Clustering for Log Analysis


This repository contains the code implementation for the below specified paper published in International Journal of Data Mining Techniques and Applications.The paper explores using document clustering techniques for automated analysis and categorization of system logs from diverse sources. It compares traditional clustering methods for organizing large log datasets and proposes efficient ways to map real-time log events to predefined categories. The work evaluates models using Entropy, Purity, and Silhouette Index, and introduces new distance measures to identify whether incoming log events belong to existing or new categories. The goal is to improve log monitoring, prioritization, and automated solution recommendations.
